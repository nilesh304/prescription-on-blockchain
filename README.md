In India, healthcare is a significant issue among the middle class. People lack the time in their hectic lives to repeatedly line up at doctor’s clinics and nor do they wish to keep paying doctor’s fees. Thus, once they’ve already consulted their doctor and followed through with his instructions till the point the prescription is over, if they are not all well, they face a choice. They can either go back to the doctor and consult him once more in which case he will perhaps write a new prescription or they can try to reuse the old prescription to get a new batch of meds. 
Admittedly, the first choice is medically recommended, the truth however is that in India people tend to opt for the second choice.

In India, patients keep taking prescribed medicines even after the prescribed time of a particular drug is over. Excess intake of some medicines are harmful for body. Ex : Gardenal Tablet which is used in seizures and insomnia, is harmful for Liver and Kidney. Patients without knowing such information keep taking the medicines which leads to bigger problem.

Using Blockchain we can easily lock a prescription after it’s been expired, preventing patients to overuse a medicine,get addicted to strong meds, and make sure patients regularly visits his/her doctor.
